abstract = {Recent advances in microelectronics and electrochemical sensing platforms have preceded the development of devices for personal monitoring and managing physiological and metabolic information that exploit sweat as a noninvasive, convenient approach for providing information about underlying health conditions, such as glucose level monitoring. Although most sweat glucose sensors have targeted applications during exercise and other active stimulation induced-sweat, natural sweating offers an attractive alternative with minimal effect on users that can be accessed during routine and sedentary activities without impeding personal lifestyle and preserves the correlation between blood and sweat glucose. Here, we present a noninvasive sweat glucose sensor with convenient hydrogel patches for rapid sampling of natural perspiration without external activities that stimulate sweating. The wearable hydrogel patch rapidly takes up natural sweat from the hand and serves as a medium for electrochemical sensing. A prussian blue-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene nanocomposite (PB-PEDOT NC) electrode provides cost-effective, stable and excellent electrocatalytic activity in sweat glucose measurements. We demonstrated sweat glucose sensor functionality by long-term measurements of glucose in sweat from human subjects consuming food and drinks. By enabling the analysis of sweat glucose during routine and sedentary activities, the sweat glucose sensor shows great promise for clinical-grade glucose management and enlarges the scope of next-generation noninvasive sensing systems.}
